How can you cope when there's nothing to cope for?

The flame I wield is made of a stabbing ice

made with a bark, with no bite.

Yet a force is controlling me,

controlling me to bellow with silence.



How do colours shine when the only colour’s black;

the night-time hasn’t turned to day since the nonchalant vessels showed a glimmer of emotion?

They don't.

Yet, vessels are still managing to stab me:

they stab me with their sombre ice,

controlling me to bellow with silence.



And then you blink, turning into one of them.



There’s nothing to cope for, nor anything to concern for.

I am the holder to this mindless freedom,

capable to let others in.

it lets me stay silent.



There is a colourless void surrounding me- perfect.

No worries nor blinding thoughts

ready to engulf me whole.

Can anyone see this?

I can’t help to notice the suppressed and scarred sunlight,

trying to let go of the ignorance.



Don’t bellow with silence but

bellow with blissful needs, before your flame turns to ice.
