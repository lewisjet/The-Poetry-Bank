You travelled:
You travelled out of what is comprehendible to any morsel
Who believes himself as competent.
In fact, by the time you have read this line, your soul and every vessel, and every cortex
In you has just embarked that oddecy, endless of times by now!

It really is a navy world, isn’t it?

Because every breath you make is recorded
As an abstract variable, made of everyone’s algorithms
Which they’ve made and nurtured until it becomes them

This world is even more navy than you thought, isn’t it? 

It’s to the point where your mind is a synthetic quadrant of vertices.
Every thing you do is recorded in a Boolean, made in your mind:
Every thing you have ever done is resting on this one integer,
In which you have drafted.
Do or do not.

But navy is dark, your synthetic mind was overrun by a single mistake in your algorithm.
Game over, but not really.
As your materialistic variables are now dropping at a fast rate,
You can’t just tab out the mistakes you’ve made, like how you could before.

No restarts anymore- because the world you live in isn’t navy, nor in black and white.

It’s a spectrum.
