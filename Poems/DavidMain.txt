Nothing materialistic is real. it’s just a figure, embedded in my empty imagination.
It shouldn’t have been this way,
but I, David, shall not fall.

I was feared; manipulating the gods into my every command.
They cowered at my knees; they would flee on sight of me.
My demand instantiated as their life,
and my vigour controlling what nous they could’ve had.
But I, David, shall not fall.

I was respected; bringing peace to the crowds- filtering the wrong from the pale.
I could stand, and my bees would salute.
They were knowledgeable, rarely they would ask a question that would be left hanging!
They knew how the hierarchy functions, and they respected that:
they knew to say, “thy, David, shall not fall.”

I was loved; emancipating my hive, from the darkness, which lurks outside.
They adored me, when I freed them from the taint, which was outside.
And now that taint functions as a mere cog in the system:
replaceable; mortal.
There ecstatic chants were a symbol of my success,
“God, David, shall not fall!”

And where am I now? Sat on the cold hard ground-
wondering what went wrong!
There chants turned into anger- foolish!
There knowledge turned into lust- foolish!
And within a mere minute, People were rioting,
“Traitor, David, Shall Fall!”

however, there words became reality.

Their chants are now a mere whistle in the wind.
Their joyous cries are nothing but memories.
All because I emancipated my subjects from the tenebrae, outside the walls of my kingdom?
That, That Can’t Be A Reason For My Fall!

Nobody should like the mindless- the pit is where they belong!
And because of that,
I, David, am immortal.
