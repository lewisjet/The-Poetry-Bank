Locked away, forbid the key,
they're content at last.
Acting like I'm five; not letting me be alive,
yet time passes sound.

Yet I take a step and they squeal.
Only after bargaining can I taste
the freedom that's outside.
I take a larger step and they cry,
"never again shall I".
And like that, I never leave their sight.

Locked away, distant key,
desperate for the status ante.
They see me cry and see that as a sign
that my autonomy doesn't work.

But by this point, it feels too late,
my mind begins to break,
I take a giant leap and I fall.

Locked in a prison of my mind,
which they perpetuate.

I realise and run away,
seeing the potential day
that I don't live like this.

Yet when I fled, I took the blame;
Was I the one locking away?
Now when I commute, they cry,
"Why didn't you say goodbye?"
When I enjoy, they beg,
"Come back, it's too dangerous."

No Thesis, no Antithesis; no Synthesis.

When I fly, they try to ground me,
though when I come back,
they penalize me.

If we differ, I'm in the wrong:
no study, research or logic.

No Thesis, no Antithesis; no Synthesis.

But what do they want?
Should I come back, lock myself away and throw the key?
Should I act like I'm five or cease being alive?
Will that stop the cries?

What have I done to deserve this cycle?
Evidence doesn't bring salvation,
yet escape will only bring shunning.
What does it take to throw the lock away,
and let me be free?
