If only they knew the sorrow that brings
over a seemingly futile thing.

If only they knew the damaged caused
from each breath that hasn’t taken a pause
because it would make them accountable.

If only they could feel the taste of tears;
flowing down someone else’s face
all because of a lie.

Letting their victim cry silently for daylight.

But they let their dagger sink into a blood feud
as the blood covers up more daylight.
All because a breath wasn’t taken
that would hold them accountable.
